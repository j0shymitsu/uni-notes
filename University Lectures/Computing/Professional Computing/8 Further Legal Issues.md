# FURTHER LEGAL ISSUES
27-11-24

## KEY POINTS

- The legal profession is **behind** the use of computing. The speed at which we can create laws is far behind that in which
we can create laws.

- e-Commerce has changed the **entire landscape of commerce.** 

- Unathorised access; needs **knowledge and intent**, needs to be **a sufficient attempt**, there doesn't need to be a 
**requirement of damage**, and is now a **serious crime** and therefore extraditable.

- **NDA's** should be **weighted towards the party revealing the information.**

- In the UK, **computer programs are unpatenable**; Web technology is only protected by **copyright and contract**.

## DETAILED NOTES


### Computer Misuse Act
There are three primary offences tied to the Computer Misuse Act:
  - Unauthorised access to a computer
  - Unauthorised access to a computer with intent to commit a serious crime
  - Unauthorised modification of the contents of a computer

A person is *guilty* of a crime if either they or the computer in question is *in the UK at time of offence*.


### Data Protection Act
"Personal data will be processed fairly and lawfully and in particular will not be processed", unless:
  - At least one condition in *schedule 2* is met (consent is given or some legal obligation offered to process data; tax
    returns law enforcement, etc.)
  - In the case of sensitive data, at least one condition in *schedule 3* is met (explicit consent is given).

2nd principle:
  - Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in
    any manner incompatible with that purpose or purposes.
  - Data can't be collected "just in case it's useful".

3rd principle:
  - Personal Data should be adequate, relavant, and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which it is
    collected.
  - Often broken without thinking.

4th principle:
  - Personal data should be accurate and where necessary, kept up-to-date. (More difficult than it sounds)

5th principle:
  - Personal data processed for any purpose(s) shouldn't be kept for longer than it is necessary;
      - Financial data needs to be kept for 7 years for auditing
      - Civil actions can be issued six years after any event
      - Common advice is that emails should be kept for 7 years
      - University exam results can be held indefinitely 
      - CCTV data is routinely deleted after one month
      - Procedures for data deletion must be rigorous and specified


### e-Commerce Laws
e-Commerce is defined as "using an electronic network to simplify and speed up all stages of the business process, from
design and making, to buying, selling and delivering"; or "the facilitation of business by electronic means".

Certain products are capable of digital delivery such as music and software. T&C's of sale are entered into through on-screen
contracting process called *click-wrap* or *web-wrap*.


### Non-Disclosure Agreements
Non-Disclosure Agreements (*NDA;s*) are the first legal need but often trated in a casual manner, not tailored for a
particular situation.

Business ideas need to be guarded for as long as possible. Competitors can copy ideas legitimately, provided they do not
copy the idea *literally*. 

NDA's should be weighted towards the party revealing the info.

Another solution is to use different NDA's for different purposes:
  - Written/verbal info
  - Technical/commercial
  - Nature of duty
  - Time limit
  - Exceptions


### Patents & Copyrights
In most countries an invention cannot be patented if it has already been published or put into the public domain (for
example, in e-mail).

In the UK, computer programs are unpatenable. Web technology is only protected by *copyright and contract*.

The *click-wrap contract* exists as a set of terms and conditions relating to the use of IPR's in online material as well as
to payment, and supply of goods and services.

## Early Computing Devices
- The **abacus** was one of the earliest computing devices.
- Advanced users could perform multiplication, division, and even square/cube roots.
- Early computers were **mechanical**, utilizing punch cards and looms for data input.

## Pioneers of Computing
1. **Charles Babbage**:
   - Designed mechanical calculators in the 19th century.
   - Developed the **Difference Engine**, an early mechanical computing device.
2. **Ada Lovelace**:
   - Worked with Babbage on the **Analytic Engine**.
   - Wrote the first computer "program" to compute **Bernoulli numbers**.
3. **Alan Turing**:
   - Regarded as the **father of computer science**.
   - Developed the **Turing Machine**, formalizing algorithms and computation.
   - Proposed the **Turing Test** to evaluate machine intelligence.

## First Digital Computers
1. **ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer)**:
   - First general-purpose, all-digital computer.
   - Developed post-WWII to calculate artillery firing tables.
   - Performed calculations **1,000 times faster** than electro-mechanical machines.
2. **The Transistor (1959)**:
   - Replaced vacuum tubes, significantly reducing size and power consumption.
   - The **MOSFET transistor** has been mass-produced over **13 sextillion** times.
3. **Integrated Circuits**:
   - Eliminated the need for discrete components, enhancing efficiency.
   - Followed **Moore’s Law**, which predicts the exponential growth of chip performance.

## Evolution of Personal Computers
1. **Microprocessors**:
   - Integrated circuits that serve as an entire **CPU** on a single chip.
2. **Apple I (1976)**:
   - One of the first full microcomputers sold to the public.
   - Priced at **$666.66** in July 1976.
   - Followed by the commercially successful **Apple II** in 1977.
3. **Sinclair ZX80 (1980)**:
   - One of the first UK computers available for under **£100**.
4. **Commodore PET & TRS-80 (1977)**:
   - Competitors to the Apple II, helping launch the personal computing revolution.

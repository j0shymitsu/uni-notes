## Introduction
- **Networking** connects devices for communication and resource sharing.
- Networks enable **global connectivity** across devices.
- Used in **business, education, and everyday life**.

---

## What is Networking?
- A network consists of **interconnected devices**.
- Devices are called **nodes or hosts**.
- Nodes can be:
  - **End devices**: Laptops, phones, servers.
  - **Network devices**: Switches, routers, access points.
- Connections use **cables or wireless signals**.

---

## Networking Media
### **Physical Cables**
- **Copper Cables**: Cheap, easy to install, but limited in speed and range.
- **Fiber Optic Cables**: High-speed transmission over long distances, but expensive.

### **Wireless Communication**
- Uses **radio signals** instead of physical cables.
- Common standards:
  - **Wi-Fi (802.11n/ac)** for home and office networks.
  - **Bluetooth (802.15)** for short-range connections.

---

## Network Models
### **Client-Server Model**
- **Servers** provide resources (email, web pages, files).
- **Clients** request and retrieve resources.
- **Advantages**: Scalable, efficient management.
- **Disadvantages**: Complex, expensive setup.

### **Network Topologies**
- **Physical Topology**: Layout of devices and cables.
- **Logical Topology**: Defines data flow within the network.
- **Common Topologies**:
  - **Star**: Most common, all devices connect to a central switch.
  - **Mesh**: Redundant connections, used in WANs.
  - **Point-to-Point**: Direct connection between two nodes.

---

## Types of Networks
- **Small Networks**: Home or office networks with a few devices.
- **Medium to Large Networks**: Corporate networks with thousands of devices.
- **Global Networks**: The Internet, connecting millions of devices worldwide.
- **Two primary types**:
  - **Local Area Network (LAN)**: Small geographic area, e.g., office network.
  - **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: Large geographic area, e.g., the Internet.

## Network Protocols and Addressing
### **OSI and TCP/IP Models**
- **OSI Model**: Standardized layers defining network communication.
- **TCP/IP Model**: Practical model used in real-world networking.
- Key layers:
  - **Application Layer**: Defines user interfaces and encryption.
  - **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable or fast data transfer (TCP vs UDP).
  - **Internet Layer**: Provides IP addressing and routing.
  - **Network Access Layer**: Manages MAC addresses and physical transmission.

### **Network Addressing**
- **MAC Address**: Unique, unchangeable hardware address for local communication.
- **IP Address**:
  - **IPv4**: 32-bit, dotted decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
  - **IPv6**: 128-bit, hexadecimal format.

### **IP Address Allocation**
- **Static IP**: Manually assigned, does not change.
- **Dynamic IP**: Assigned by **DHCP server**, changes over time.
- **Private IPs**: Used within local networks (e.g., 192.168.x.x).
- **Public IPs**: Used on the Internet, globally unique.

## Conclusion
- Networking enables **communication and resource sharing**.
- Different media types include **wired and wireless connections**.
- **Network models and protocols** define communication rules.
- **IP addressing** ensures data reaches the correct device.
- Understanding networking fundamentals is **essential for IT professionals**.

- **Logic Gates and Boolean Algebra**:

    - Basic Gates:
        - NOT: Inverts input (A --> A')
        - AND: Output is 1 only if both inputs are 1 (A · B)
        - OR: Output is 1 if any input is 1 (A + B)

    - Derived Gates:
        - NAND: NOT AND (A · B)' - Universal gate
        - NOR: NOT OR (A + B)' - Universal gate

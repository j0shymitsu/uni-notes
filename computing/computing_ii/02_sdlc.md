## Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose of the SDLC.
- Recognize when to use adaptive approaches instead of predictive ones.
- Distinguish between a model, tool, technique, and methodology.

---

## What is SDLC?
- SDLC is a process for changing existing systems or creating new ones.
- It covers planning, building, deploying, using, and updating an information system.
- Provides a framework for managing systems development, with predictive and adaptive approaches.

---

## The SDLC Phases
- **Project Planning**: Initiate project, ensure feasibility, schedule planning, obtain approval.
- **Requirement Analysis**: Understand business needs and processing requirements.
- **Design**: Define solution based on requirements and decisions from analysis.
- **Implementation and Testing**: Construct, test, train users, install new system.
- **Support**: Maintain, enhance, support users and the system after deployment.

---

## Predictive Approach (Traditional SDLC)
- Scope defined upfront, detailed schedule created, feasibility confirmed.
- Project is staffed and launched.
- All requirements must be known in advance.
- Frozen deliverables for each phase inhibit flexibility.
- Less suitable for dynamic projects; little customer preview until late.

## Adaptive Approaches to SDLC
- **Iterative Model**: Development proceeds in small cycles with repeated improvements. Continuous feedback loop; flexible to changes.
- **Incremental Model**: Delivers software in small, functional parts (increments). Each increment adds functionality; built using iterations.
- **Spiral Model**: Risk-driven, combines iterative and waterfall elements. Prototypes after each cycle, incorporates feedback; best for larger projects.
- **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Fast, collaborative, adapts to change. Scrum focuses on evolving product backlog, continuous prioritization.
- **Agile Modeling**: Prioritizes working software, adaptability, and team collaboration. Unified Process (UP) has inception, elaboration, construction, and transition phases.

## Key Concepts
- **Model**: Abstracts important aspects of the real world for planning or budgeting. Often diagrams or charts.
- **Tool**: Software or support aids (e.g., drawing programs, CASE tools, project software like Visio or MS Project).
- **Technique**: Guidelines for completing activities, step-by-step instructions, or general advice.
- **Methodology**: Collection of models, tools, techniques—comprehensive guidelines for SDLC activities.

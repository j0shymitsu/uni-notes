## Detailed Notes

### The Monty Hall Problem:

The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. When the player first makes their choice, there is a 2/3 chance that the car is behind one of the doors not chosen. This probability does not change after the host reveals a goat behind one of the unchosen doors. When the host provides information about the two unchosen doors (revealing that one of them does not have the car behind it), the 2/3 chance of the car being behind one of the unchosen doors rests on the unchosen and unrevealed door, as opposed to the 1/3 chance of the car being behind the door the contestant chose initially.

### The Knapsack Problem:

Algorithm to solve:

	- Try 2 cube combo
	
	- Loop for each cube
	- Loop remaining
	
	- Choose next
	- Calc weight
	- Store answer
	
	- Try 3 cube combo
	- Try 4
	- Try 5 (etc)
	- Review all results
	
	- Discard overweight results
	- Select max value results
	- Display

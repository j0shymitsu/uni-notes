## Key Concepts

- Use flowcharts for summary; pseudocode for low level.
- Flowcharts are an easy way of representing a process or problem in an easy to understand format.

## Detailed Notes

### Example of Pseudocode:
(Capitalising keywords in pseudo helps make it more legible!)
	#START
	
	#CHECK current room temperature
	
		#IF current remp < 25c
		
		#TURN ON central heating
		
		#WAIT for room to reach desired temp
		
		#ELSE if current temp => 25c
		
		#DO NOTHING
	
	#END

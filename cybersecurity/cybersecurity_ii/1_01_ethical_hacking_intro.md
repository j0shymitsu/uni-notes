## What's covered?
- Attack techniques, approaches, and methodologies.
- Exploitation techniques, such as: buffer overflows, stack overflows, heap attacks and use after frees.
- Attack methods including system, host, network, and web-based attacks.
- Social engineering awareness and mitigation.
- Network security and attacks
- Use of penetration testing tools
- Network tapping/sniffing detection.
- Wireless and mobile hacking.
- Ethical issues surrounding all of the above.

## Competetencies
- Understand and demonstrate software exploitation techniques
- Demonstrate an understanding of counter-measures against exploitation techniques
- Demonstrate systematic understanding of secure system design and software protection methods.
- Demonstrate the correct use of tools and techniques in a successful penetration test.
- Understand ways of gaining access to networks and performing monitoring on networks.
- Perform penetration testing on networks and systems, identifying vulnerable systems.
- Understand the weakness in networks and software to mitigate attacks and exploitation.

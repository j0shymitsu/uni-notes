## Types of Hackers
1. **White-Hat Hackers**:
   - Ethical hackers who test systems for vulnerabilities with permission.
   - Goal: Strengthen system security by reporting and recommending fixes.

2. **Black-Hat Hackers**:
   - Malicious attackers aiming to exploit systems for personal gain.
   - Activities: Stealing information, altering system functions, and more.

3. **Grey-Hat Hackers**:
   - Act without authorization but without malicious intent.
   - Often disclose vulnerabilities to owners, sometimes seeking payment.

## Penetration Testing
- **Definition**:
  - Systematic evaluation of a systemâ€™s security by simulating real attacks.
  - Involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Key Differences**:
  - Unlike vulnerability assessments, penetration testing verifies and exploits weaknesses to assess potential damage.

## Penetration Testing Scope
1. **Possible Tasks**:
   - Assess custom web/mobile applications.
   - Test wireless networks and physical security controls.
   - Perform social engineering and client-side attacks.
2. **Internal Testing**:
   - Simulates insider threats (e.g., malicious employees).
3. **External Testing**:
   - Simulates attacks from external networks (e.g., the internet).

## Penetration Testing Lifecycle
1. **Engagement**:
   - Define scope, goals, and legal agreements (e.g., NDAs, Rules of Engagement).
   - Discuss testing windows, communication methods, and limitations.
2. **Information Gathering**:
   - Gather OSINT (open-source intelligence) to expand the attack surface.
   - Identify IPs, hosts, and software versions.
3. **Footprinting and Scanning**:
   - Map the network and scan for live hosts, open ports, and running services.
4. **Threat Modeling**:
   - Evaluate the impact of vulnerabilities to prioritize attack plans.
5. **Vulnerability Assessment**:
   - Identify misconfigurations, open ports, and missing patches.
6. **Exploitation**:
   - Execute exploits to verify vulnerabilities.
   - Example findings: Default credentials, outdated software, open ports.

## Tools and Techniques
1. **Network Mapping**:
   - Use tools like `ping`, `fping`, and `nmap` to discover live hosts and open ports.
2. **OSINT Tools**:
   - Netcraft, WHOIS, DNS reconnaissance, and social media analysis.
3. **Vulnerability Scanners**:
   - Examples: Nessus, OpenVAS, Nexpose.
4. **Exploitation Tools**:
   - Example: Metasploit (beyond this module's scope).

## Key Takeaways
1. **Types of Testing**:
   - Understand the scope of penetration testing (internal vs. external).
2. **Lifecycle**:
   - Each phase builds on the previous, from engagement to exploitation.
3. **Tools**:
   - Combine OSINT, scanning tools, and vulnerability assessments to strengthen penetration tests.

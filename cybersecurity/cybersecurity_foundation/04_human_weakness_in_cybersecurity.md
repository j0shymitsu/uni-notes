## The Human Factor
- Security issues often arise due to human error or manipulation, not just technical vulnerabilities.
- Attackers exploit human nature through:
  - Frantic callers or polite individuals.
  - Maintenance uniforms or familiar names.
  - Bait items like USB sticks.

---

## Social Engineering
1. **Phishing**:
   - Fake emails, messages, or websites used to steal sensitive information.
2. **Baiting**:
   - Entices victims with free software or misplaced USB drives containing malware.
3. **Impersonation**:
   - Attackers pose as authority figures or trusted individuals to manipulate targets.
4. **Pretexting**:
   - Fabricating scenarios to gain trust and access private information.
5. **Tailgating/Piggybacking**:
   - Gaining physical access by following authorized personnel into restricted areas.

## Human Error
- **Definition**:
  - Mistakes or lapses leading to breaches of acceptable system limits.
- **Types**:
  1. **Skill-Based Errors**:
     - Slips or lapses during routine tasks.
  2. **Decision-Based Errors**:
     - Faulty decisions or violations of protocol.

### Examples
- **Weak Passwords**:
  - Reusing passwords or using predictable patterns like "1234" or "password."
- **Misdelivery**:
  - Sending sensitive data to unintended recipients.
- **Phishing**:
  - Falling for fraudulent emails or malicious links.

---

## Canary Tokens
- **Definition**:
  - Unique links or tokens designed to detect unauthorized access or interactions.
- **Usage**:
  - Alerts the creator with details like IP address and user agent when triggered.
  - Applied defensively or for information gathering.

## Group Activity: “What Went Wrong?”
### Case Studies
1. **Target Data Breach (2013)**:
   - Hackers stole credit card data via a third-party HVAC vendor.
2. **Equifax Data Breach (2017)**:
   - Unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability exposed 147 million records.
3. **Ashley Madison Breach (2015)**:
   - Poor password management and weak encryption leaked 32 million records.
4. **Marriott Breach (2018)**:
   - Hackers accessed databases, exposing up to 500 million guest records.

## Security vs. Usability
- **Dilemma**:
  - Stronger security measures (e.g., complex passwords) reduce usability.
  - Weaker measures improve usability but increase vulnerability.
- **The Triangle Paradox**:
  - Balancing Security, Functionality, and Usability is challenging.

---

## Password Attacks
- **Brute Force**:
  - Tries every possible combination until a match is found.
  - Time-consuming but guarantees success eventually.
- **Dictionary Attacks**:
  - Uses precompiled lists of common passwords.
- **Cracking Weak Passwords**:
  - Tools like John the Ripper can be used to hash and test passwords.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Human Weakness**:
   - Exploited through manipulation, errors, and weak security practices.
2. **Social Engineering**:
   - Targets trust to bypass technical defenses.
3. **Balancing Security and Usability**:
   - Essential for effective and practical cybersecurity measures.

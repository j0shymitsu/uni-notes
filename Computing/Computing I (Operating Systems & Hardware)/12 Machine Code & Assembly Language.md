## Abstraction in Computing
- **Definition**:
  - The concept of viewing a system at different levels of complexity.
- **Levels of Abstraction**:
  - **High-Level**: Applications and programming languages (e.g., Java, Python).
  - **Mid-Level**: Algorithms, compilers, and operating systems.
  - **Low-Level**: CPU design, buses, and logic gates.
  - **Hardware Level**: Transistors and circuits.

## Machine Code
- **Definition**:
  - The lowest level of software, consisting of binary instructions executed by the CPU.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Operates entirely on **binary numbers**.
  - Controlled by **data flowing through buses**.
  - Each CPU component reacts to specific **binary input patterns**.

### **Simple 4-bit CPU Example**
- Registers: **A** and **B** (store values from `0000` to `1111`).
- Example Instructions:
  - Store value in **A**.
  - Store value in **B**.
  - Output **A** or **B**.
  - Add **B** to **A**.
  - Subtract **B** from **A**.
  - Increment or decrement **A**.

## Assembly Language
- **Definition**:
  - A **human-readable representation** of machine code.
- **Purpose**:
  - Simplifies programming at the hardware level.
  - Uses **mnemonics** (short codes) instead of binary numbers.
- **Example Instructions**:

`STO A, 3 ; Store 3 in register A STO B, 5 ; Store 5 in register B ADD A, B ; Add B to A (A = A + B) OUT A ; Output the result`

---

## Programming with Assembly
### **Extending the Language**
- **More Registers**:
- Increase from **A and B** to **A-H** for more storage.
- **More Instructions**:
- `CMP A, B`: Compare A and B.
- `JEQ LABEL`: Jump to a label if the last comparison was equal.
- `JMP LABEL`: Jump to a label unconditionally.

### **Example: Multiplication by Repeated Addition**
- Multiplying `3 Ã— 7` using loops:

`STO A, 0 ; Start with A = 0 STO B, 3 ; Set multiplier (3) STO C, 7 ; Set loop counter (7) Loop: ADD A, B ; Add B to A DEC C ; Decrease counter CMP C, 0 ; Check if counter is zero JEQ End ; If zero, jump to end JMP Loop ; Otherwise, repeat End: OUT A ; Output the result`

## Data Structures in Assembly
- **Stack Operations**:
- **PUSH**: Add a value to the top of the stack.
- **POP**: Remove a value from the stack.
- Example:
  ```
  PUSH A  ; Store A onto the stack
  POP B   ; Retrieve value from stack into B
  ```

---

## Modern Instruction Sets
- **Instruction Set Architectures (ISA)**:
- Define the machine code a CPU can execute.
- **Types**:
1. **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)**:
   - Simple, fast instructions.
   - Example: ARM processors.
2. **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing)**:
   - More complex instructions.
   - Example: x86 architecture.

## Summary
1. **Machine code** is binary-based and runs directly on hardware.
2. **Assembly language** provides a more readable way to write low-level programs.
3. **Programming in assembly** requires working with registers, jumps, and logic.
4. **Modern processors** use either **RISC** or **CISC** instruction sets.

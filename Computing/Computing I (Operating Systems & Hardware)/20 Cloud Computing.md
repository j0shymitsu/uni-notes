## Introduction
- Cloud computing represents a **shift in how computing resources are provided and consumed**.
- It builds on **virtualisation**, allowing scalable and flexible service delivery.

---

## Virtualisation
- **Virtualisation** allows multiple operating systems to run on the same physical hardware.
- A **hypervisor** enables creation of **virtual machines**.
- Reduces costs, improves redundancy, and increases efficiency.
- Forms the **foundation of cloud services**.

---

## What is Cloud Computing?
- A **network of servers** that deliver IT capabilities over the internet.
- Services include software, storage, servers, and platforms.
- Definitions:
  - Staten (2009): "Standardised IT capability delivered via internet technologies in a pay-per-use, self-service way."
  - The 451 Group: "IT presented as a service, delivered by virtualised resources."

### Key Benefits:
- **Cost Savings** – Pay only for what you use.
- **Scalability** – Scale up/down easily.
- **Flexibility** – Adapt to changing needs.
- **Redundancy & Backup** – Built-in high availability.

---

## Business Drivers for Cloud Adoption
- **Efficiency**: Focus on core business, not infrastructure.
- **Rapid Implementation**: Faster deployment than traditional data centres.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Easier with cloud.
- **Global Collaboration**: Access from any location.

---

## Cloud Service Models
### **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
- Centrally hosted apps accessible over the internet.
- Users do not manage the underlying infrastructure.
- **Examples:** Microsoft 365, Dropbox, Google Workspace.

### **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- Provides a platform for developers to build, test, and deploy applications.
- No need to manage hardware or operating systems.
- **Examples:** Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure.

### **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- Offers virtualised hardware over the internet.
- Users manage OS, storage, and applications.
- **Examples:** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Rackspace.

---

## Cloud Deployment Models
### **Public Cloud**
- Infrastructure is owned by **third-party providers**.
- **Pay-per-use**, easy to deploy and scale.
- **Examples:** AWS, Microsoft Azure.

### **Private Cloud**
- Dedicated to a **single organisation**.
- Greater **control and security**, but **higher initial costs**.

### **Hybrid Cloud**
- Combines **public and private** cloud elements.
- Offers flexibility and **load balancing**.
- Ideal for **dynamic workloads**.

---

## Summary and Case Study
- Cloud computing is becoming the **default model** for IT infrastructure.
- Enables **high-performance computing, game streaming**, and more.
- **Amazon S3 Case Study**:
  - Highly scalable and reliable storage service.
  - Used by major platforms like **Reddit, Pinterest, Tumblr**.
  - Offers "nine nines" (99.999999999%) durability.

---

## Conclusion
- Cloud computing is a **scalable, cost-effective, and flexible** solution for businesses.
- **Service models (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS)** cater to various business needs.
- **Deployment models** (public, private, hybrid) allow strategic resource management.
- The cloud is a **driving force** in digital transformation.

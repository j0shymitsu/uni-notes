## Introduction
- **Fractional equations** contain fractions where the unknown variable appears in the numerator or denominator.
- The methods used to solve them are similar to **linear, quadratic, and simultaneous equations**.
- The key goal is to **isolate the unknown variable**.

## Understanding Fractional Equations
### **Common Denominators**
- When dealing with fractions, it is often necessary to **find a common denominator** before solving.
- This allows for **simplifying and rearranging** the equation effectively.

### **Isolating the Unknown Variable**
- If the variable is part of a fraction, the equation must be **manipulated to remove it from the fraction**.
- Multiplication or cross-multiplication is often used.

Example:
```
 x / 3 = 5  → Multiply both sides by 3 →  x = 15
```

## Solving Fractional Equations
### **Variable in the Numerator**
- The fraction can be removed by multiplying by the **reciprocal**.
- Example:
  ```
  (x / 4) = 3  → Multiply both sides by 4 → x = 12
  ```

### **Variable in the Denominator**
- When the variable appears in the denominator, **cross-multiplication** can be used.
- Example:
  ```
  5 / x = 2 → Multiply both sides by x → 5 = 2x → x = 5/2
  ```

### **General Rules for Solving Fractional Equations**
1. Identify the **common denominator** (if necessary).
2. Multiply to **eliminate fractions**.
3. Isolate the variable.
4. Check for **validity** (i.e., ensure no division by zero occurs).

Example:
```
 (x + 3) / 5 = 4  → Multiply by 5 → x + 3 = 20 → x = 17
```

## Manipulating Formulae
### **Applications in Science and Engineering**
- **Physics:** Motion equations use fractional forms (e.g., velocity = distance/time).
- **Finance:** Compound interest and debt calculations rely on fraction-based formulas.
- **Engineering:** Rearranging equations to solve for specific parameters (e.g., electrical resistance, acceleration).

Example from kinematics:
```
v^2 = u^2 + 2as → Rearranging for a → a = (v^2 - u^2) / 2s
```

### **Compound Interest Formula:**
```
 A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
```
- Used in financial modeling to **calculate exponential growth of investments**.

## Conclusion
- **Fractional equations are solved by eliminating fractions and isolating variables.**
- **Cross-multiplication and common denominators are key techniques.**
- **Manipulating formulas is crucial in physics, engineering, and finance.**
- Mastering these techniques helps in solving **real-world mathematical problems**.

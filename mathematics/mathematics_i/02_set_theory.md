## Set Theory
- **Definition**:
  - A formal, mathematical method of grouping data with similar characteristics.
  - Widely applicable in computing for database searches, user categorization, and problem visualization.

- **Example**:
  - Categorizing emojis into sets:
    - Humans: `{ðŸ˜€, ðŸ¤­, ðŸ’€, ðŸ‘½}`
    - Faces: `{ðŸ˜€, ðŸ¤­, ðŸ’€, ðŸ‘½, ðŸ’­}`.

## Venn Diagrams
- **Purpose**:
  - Visual representation of sets and their relationships.
  - Highlights overlap (intersection) and exclusive areas.

- **Key Terms**:
  1. **Union**:
     - Combines all items from both sets.
     - Example: Humans âˆª Faces = `{ðŸ˜€, ðŸ¤­, ðŸ’€, ðŸ‘½, ðŸ’­}`.
  2. **Intersection**:
     - Items common to both sets.
     - Example: Humans âˆ© Faces = `{ðŸ˜€, ðŸ¤­, ðŸ’€, ðŸ‘½}`.
  3. **Difference**:
     - Items in one set but not the other.
     - Example:
       - Humans - Faces = `{surfer, jockey}`.
       - Faces - Humans = `{alien, wolf}`.

## Introduction
- **Quadratic equations** are equations where the highest power of the variable is 2.
- They appear in **physics, engineering, computer graphics, machine learning, and cybersecurity**.
- Understanding their properties helps in **modelling real-world and computational problems**.

## Types of Equations (Revision)
- **Linear equations**: No squared terms, one unique solution.
- **Quadratic equations**: Includes squared terms, can have **zero, one, or two solutions**.
- **Higher-order equations**: Include cubed or higher powers (e.g., quintic, septic).
- **Simultaneous equations**: Systems of multiple equations that share variables.

## Quadratic Equations and Parabolic Curves
- **Quadratic equations form parabolic curves**:
  - `ax² + bx + c = 0` where `a, b, c` are constants.
- **Graphical representation**:
  - When `a > 0`, the graph is **U-shaped (smiley face 😊)**.
  - When `a < 0`, the graph is **arch-shaped (sad face ☹️)**.
- **Conic Sections**:
  - The **parabola** is one of the fundamental conic sections studied in **geometry and physics**.

## Solving Quadratic Equations
Quadratic equations can be solved using different methods:

### **Factorisation**
- Example:
  ```math
  x² + 7x + 12 = 0
  (x + 3)(x + 4) = 0
  Solutions: x = -3, x = -4
  ```

### **Quadratic Formula**
- Universal formula for any quadratic equation:
  ```math
  x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
  ```
- Example:
  ```math
  x² - 4x - 5 = 0
  x = (4 ± √(16 + 20)) / 2
  x = (4 ± 6) / 2
  Solutions: x = 5, x = -1
  ```

### **Completing the Square**
- More advanced method, useful for **graphing transformations**.
- Example:
  ```math
  x² + 6x + 5 = 0
  (x + 3)² - 9 + 5 = 0
  (x + 3)² = 4
  Solutions: x = -1, x = -5
  ```

## Applications of Quadratic Equations
### **Physics and Engineering: Trajectories**
- Any object in **free-fall** or **projectile motion** follows a **parabolic path**.
- Used in designing:
  - **Bridges** (suspension cables follow an inverted parabola).
  - **Parabolic reflectors** (satellite dishes, headlights).

### **Computer Games: Game Physics**
- Quadratic equations simulate:
  - **Projectile motion (Angry Birds, cannons, jumping mechanics).**
  - **Collision detection and object movement.**

### **Machine Learning: Quadratic Classifiers**
- **Quadratic classifiers** separate datasets using curved decision boundaries.
- More flexible than **linear classifiers** in complex classification tasks.

### **Cryptography & Cybersecurity**
- **Quadratic probing** resolves hash table collisions.
- **Multivariate public key cryptosystems (MPKC)** use quadratic polynomials in encryption.

### **Algorithm Complexity & Processing Speed**
- Some algorithms have **quadratic time complexity (`O(n²)`)**.
- Example: **Bubble sort**, **nested loops**, **graph algorithms**.

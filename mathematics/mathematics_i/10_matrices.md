## Introduction
- **Matrices** are fundamental structures in mathematics and computing.
- They are used for **data representation, transformations, and solving systems**.
- Applications include **graphics, simulations, VR, finance, and engineering**.

---

## What is a Matrix?
- A matrix is a **rectangular array** of quantities arranged in **rows and columns**.
- Treated as a **single entity**, matrices follow specific **mathematical rules**.
- Widely used in **science, engineering, and computer programming**.

---

## Using Matrices to Represent Data
- Matrices are often used to represent related quantities:
  - E.g., bakery prices and daily sales.
- Useful for **storing and processing tabular data**.

---

## Matrix Notation
- Named using **capital letters** (e.g., `A`, `B`).
- Individual elements use lowercase with subscripts: `a_ij` where `i` = row, `j` = column.
- **Rows are horizontal**, **columns are vertical**.

---

## Matrices and Programming
- Matrices can be represented as **arrays** in code:
  - 1D, 2D, or 3D arrays.
- Arrays in languages like Java, Python, or C++ are used to perform **matrix operations**.

---

## Matrix Operations
### **Addition and Subtraction**
- Matrices must be the **same size**.
- Add/subtract corresponding elements.
- Example:
  ```
  [3 8] + [4 0] = [7 8]
  [4 6] + [1 -9] = [5 -3]
  ```

### **Scalar Multiplication**
- Multiply each element of a matrix by a constant (scalar).
- Scales the entire matrix up or down.

### **Matrix Multiplication (Dot Product)**
- Multiply rows from the first matrix by columns of the second.
- Used in **graphics, transformations, and simulations**.
- Example: Pie shop takings calculation.

### **Cross Product**
- Used primarily with **vectors**, often in **physics or engineering**.
- Less commonly used in this module but important for context.

### **Matrix Division â€“ Inverse Matrices**
- Matrices cannot be directly divided.
- Instead, multiply by the **inverse matrix**.
- Inverse of 2x2 matrix:
  - Swap `a` and `d`
  - Negate `b` and `c`
  - Divide all by `ad - bc` (called the **determinant**).

---

## Applications in Computing
- Matrices are used in:
  - **Computer graphics:** 2D/3D transformations
  - **Simulations and physics engines**
  - **Solving systems of equations**
  - **AI and machine learning**
- Interactive transformation tools available online (e.g., mathsisfun.com).

---

## Conclusion
- **Matrices are powerful tools** for mathematical and computational applications.
- Knowing how to **represent, manipulate, and apply matrices** is vital for computing.
- Ensure you're confident with **notation, operations, and application scenarios**.

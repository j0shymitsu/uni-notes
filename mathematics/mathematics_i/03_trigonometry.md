## Overview
- **The historical origins** of geometry and trigonometry  
- **The Cartesian coordinate system** and how to use coordinates to describe positions  
- **Applications of coordinate geometry** in computing  
- **Trigonometric principles**, including Pythagoras’ theorem and the SOH-CAH-TOA mnemonic  
- **Real-world uses** of these mathematical techniques in science and technology 

## The Antikythera Mechanism
- The Antikythera Mechanism – an early mechanical computer  
  - 2000+ year old mechanical computing device from ancient Greece  
  - Allowed users to calculate astronomical data for future dates  
  - Included a user guide, engraved on one of the brass plates  
  - Changed ideas about the development of technology  
  - Inspired the Indiana Jones film *The Dial of Destiny*  

## Measuring the World  
- **Origins of Geometry & Trigonometry**  
  - "Geo" = the earth / the world  
  - "Tri" = three  
  - "Metry" = measuring  
  - Geometry = measuring the earth  
  - Trigonometry = measuring triangles  

- **Why are angles and triangles important?**  
  - Used in navigation, astronomy, and construction  
  - Applications date back thousands of years  

- **Equinox & Ancient Monuments**  
  - The sun rises due east and sets due west on the equinox (approx. 21st March / 21st September)  
  - Used as a basis for early calendars  
  - Stonehenge and other ancient monuments are aligned with astronomical events  

- **Early Navigation**  
  - Before compasses, navigation relied on the position of the sun and stars  
  - Measuring angles and distances was crucial for safe travel  

## The Influence of Greek, Roman & Arab Scholars  
- Many mathematical and scientific terms have Latin and Greek roots  
- Greek philosophers (~2300-2500 years ago) laid the foundation of modern science  
- Roman Empire (~2500-1500 years ago) built upon Greek knowledge  
- Arab, Jewish, and Persian scholars (~1400-700 years ago) translated and expanded upon Greek and Latin texts  
- The Renaissance (~600-300 years ago) led to modern science, maths, and industry  

## Cartesian Geometry  
- **René Descartes (1596-1650)**  
  - French philosopher & mathematician  
  - Famous for *"I think, therefore I am."*  
  - Introduced the **Cartesian Coordinate System**  
  - Defined locations on a flat surface using **X and Y coordinates**  

## Coordinate Geometry  
- **Using a Grid System**  
  - The Exton Park campus map is divided into squares labeled with letters (horizontal) and numbers (vertical)  
  - Example: The All-Weather Pitch spans **B3 and C3**  
  - Any location can be identified using a coordinate pair **(X, Y)**  

- **Coordinate System Basics**  
  - The **X-axis** is horizontal, and the **Y-axis** is vertical  
  - The **origin (0,0)** is where the two axes cross  
  - **Negative coordinates** exist to the left (for X) and below (for Y)  

- **3D Coordinates**  
  - The **Z-axis** extends outwards and inwards from the screen  

## Applications in Computing  
- Grids and coordinate systems are used in various computing applications  
  - **Graphics programming** (game development, UI design)  
  - **Mapping and navigation**  
  - **Data visualization**  

## Plotting the Equation of a Straight Line  
- **Features of a Straight Line Graph**  
  - **Slope (m)** - how steep the line is  
  - **Intercept (b)** - where the line crosses the Y-axis  

## Trigonometry  
- **Origins**  
  - Discovered and used thousands of years ago  
  - Egyptians applied trigonometry for construction (~4000+ years ago)  
  - Essential today for navigation, physics, engineering, and more  

- **Right-Angled Triangles**  
  - Contains one 90° angle  
  - The **hypotenuse** is always opposite the right angle  

### Pythagoras’ Theorem  
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2
  \]
  where *c* is the hypotenuse  
- Example:  
  - **3-4-5 Triangle:**  
    \[
    3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2
    \]
    \[
    9 + 16 = 25
    \]
- Useful for calculating unknown side lengths in right-angled triangles  

### Trigonometric Ratios  
- **SOH-CAH-TOA:**  
  - **Sine:** `sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse`  
  - **Cosine:** `cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse`  
  - **Tangent:** `tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent`  

- **Using a Calculator:**  
  1. Open a scientific calculator  
  2. Enter the angle (e.g. `30°`)  
  3. Press `sin`, `cos`, or `tan` to get the values  

### The Sine, Cosine & Tangent Functions  
- **Sine Wave**  
  - A **sin(x) graph** forms a repeating wave pattern  
  - Many natural phenomena follow this pattern, such as:  
    - Sound waves  
    - Daylight variation  
    - Tidal heights  
    - Alternating current in electricity  

### Practice Questions  
- Identify the **adjacent**, **opposite**, and **hypotenuse** in a right-angled triangle  
- Calculate **sin(90°), sin(30°), cos(180°), cos(30°), tan(45°), tan(90°), tan(91°)**

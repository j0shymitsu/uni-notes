## Introduction
- **Algebra** is the mathematical study of unknown values.
- Often used in computing to **find unknown variables** in problem-solving.
- **Linear equations** are one of the simplest types of equations.
- Understanding algebra helps in programming, data analysis, and engineering.

## Algebra and Equations
- The term **Algebra** comes from Arabic **"ilm al-jabr wa'l-muqābala"**, meaning "the science of restoring what is missing and equating like with like".
- Based on the work of **Muhammad ibn Mūsa al-Khwārizmī**, whose name also led to the term **Algorithm**.
- **Equations** are mathematical statements where both sides of an equal sign must be balanced.
- Example:
  ```
  2 + x = 4
  ```
  - The unknown **x** can be solved by simple arithmetic.

## What is a Linear Equation?
- **Linear equations** are equations where variables appear with a power of **1** (no squares, cubes, or roots).
- They represent **straight lines** in a graphical representation.
- General form:
  ```
  y = mx + c
  ```
  - `m` is the **gradient** (slope of the line).
  - `c` is the **y-intercept** (where the line crosses the y-axis).
- Examples:
  - **Ohm’s Law:** `V = IR`
  - **Newton’s Second Law:** `F = ma`
  - **Download calculation:** `Total Data = Speed × Time`

## Practical Applications of Linear Equations
- Used in **computer programming** for calculations.
- **Data structures and algorithms** often use algebraic operations.
- Important in **machine learning models** for predictive analysis.
- Helps in solving **real-world problems** like finance, physics, and engineering.

---

## Algebraic Definitions
- **Coefficient**: A number that multiplies a variable (e.g., `3x` → `3` is the coefficient).
- **Constant**: A fixed value (e.g., `+5` in `3x + 5`).
- **Term**: A single part of an equation (e.g., `3x`, `5`, `-2y`).
- **Expression**: A combination of terms without an equal sign (e.g., `3x + 5`).
- **Equation**: An expression **with** an equals sign (e.g., `3x + 5 = 11`).

---

## Evaluating Expressions
- **Evaluating** means finding the value of an expression given specific values.
- Example:
  ```
  If x = 4, then 2x + 3 = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  ```

---

## Simplifying Expressions
### Adding and Subtracting Like Terms
- Identify terms with the same variables and combine them.
  ```
  a - 7 + 3a - 3 = (a + 3a) + (-7 - 3) = 4a - 10
  ```
- Works similarly with multiple variables:
  ```
  3a - 4b - 7a - 3b = (3a - 7a) + (-4b - 3b) = -4a - 7b
  ```

### Removing Brackets
- Apply the distributive property:
  ```
  a(b + c) = ab + ac
  ```
- Example:
  ```
  4(x + 2y) = 4x + 8y
  ```

---

## Solving Linear Equations
- The goal is to **isolate the unknown variable**.
- **General Rules** for moving terms across the equals sign:
  - `+` becomes `-`
  - `-` becomes `+`
  - `×` becomes `÷`
  - `÷` becomes `×`

### Examples:
```
Solve x + 7 = 12
x = 12 - 7
x = 5
```
```
Solve 2x - 3 = 7
2x = 7 + 3
2x = 10
x = 10 / 2
x = 5
```
```
Solve 3(2x + 1) = 2x + 11
6x + 3 = 2x + 11
6x - 2x = 11 - 3
4x = 8
x = 8 / 4
x = 2
```

## Why Simplify and Rearrange?
- **In programming**, simplified expressions save memory and improve performance.
- **In mathematics**, rearranging makes it easier to solve problems.
- Incorrect simplifications lead to errors in **coding and real-world calculations**.

## Conclusion
- **Linear equations** form the foundation of algebra and computing mathematics.
- **Simplifying and solving** equations efficiently is essential for programming and problem-solving.
- **Next week:** We build on this knowledge to study **quadratic equations**.

## Mathematics and Computing
- **Historical Importance**:
  - Early computers were designed for calculations:
    - Code breaking (e.g., Lorenz ciphers, Colossus at Bletchley Park).
    - Rocket science, finance, and accounting.
    - Transport and government planning.
  - Early computer scientists were mostly mathematicians (e.g., Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing).

- **Mathematics in Modern Computing**:
  - Programming languages and tools are math-based.
  - Logical and mathematical thinking underpins:
    - Programming.
    - System design.
    - Simulations and decision-making software.

## Mathematics in Action: Examples
1. **Set Theory**:
   - Useful for visualizing user roles and permissions.
   - Example: Differentiating access for customers, customer service agents, and system administrators.

2. **Simulations**:
   - Example: Aerodynamics visualizations for car designs.
   - Requires:
     - Advanced math and physics.
     - High accuracy to avoid costly or dangerous mistakes.

3. **Everyday Apps**:
   - Financial calculators and decision-making tools.
   - Relies on algebra and provides critical information for users.

4. **Exponential Growth**:
   - Examples: Population growth, savings, and customer modeling.
   - Programmers model these phenomena mathematically for accurate results.

## Assessment and Accreditation
- **Why a Maths Module?**:
  - Mathematics is fundamental to computing.
  - The British Computer Society (BCS) requires a basic maths module for all accredited degrees.

- **Assessment Details**:
  - Final exam at the end of the course.
  - Exact date to be confirmed via Moodle and email.
  - **Note**: In-person exam; extensions are not possible. Deferrals and reassessments follow standard rules.

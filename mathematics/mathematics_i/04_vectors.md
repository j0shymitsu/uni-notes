## What is a Vector?
- The meaning of "vector" varies by context:
  - **Medicine**: A carrier of disease (e.g., mosquitoes as malaria vectors).
  - **Programming**: A list where order matters.
  - **Mathematics**: A list where items **represent direction and position**.
- **Two key features**:
  1. **Magnitude** – The length of the vector (distance from tail to tip).
  2. **Direction** – The angle between the vector and a reference axis.

---

## Understanding Magnitude and Direction
- **Magnitude**:
  - Represents **distance traveled** (e.g., 20km, 2000km).
- **Direction**:
  - Specifies which way to move.
  - Example:
    - Traveling **40 miles from Chester** could lead to different destinations based on direction (Manchester, Shrewsbury, or the Irish Sea!).

---

## Vector Addition
- **Vectors can be added together to find a resultant vector**.
- **Example**:
  - Direct route from A to B.
  - Indirect route through **intermediate points (C, D)**.
- **Commutative Property**:
  - `Vector A + Vector B = Vector B + Vector A`
  - However, **distance traveled differs**, even if the start and end points are the same.

### **Vector Notation**
- Vectors are often written in **bold** or with start and finish points:
  - **a = (x₁, y₁)**
  - **b = (x₂, y₂)**
  - **Resultant vector**: `a + b = (x₁ + x₂, y₁ + y₂)`

---

## Vector Subtraction
- **Subtracting a vector reverses its direction**.
- Example:
`a = (1,2), b = (3,2) a + b = (1+3, 2+2) = (4,4)`


---

## Vector Multiplication
- **Scalar Multiplication**:
- Multiplying a vector by a number (scalar) **scales its magnitude**.
- **Direction remains unchanged**.
- Example:

  `a = (10, 20)`
  `2a = (20, 40)`
  `0.1a = (1, 2)`

- **Other types of vector multiplication** (e.g., dot product, cross product) exist but are beyond the scope of this session.

---

## Calculating Magnitude Using Pythagoras’ Theorem
- **Formula**:

`|a| = √(x² + y²)`

- Example:

`a = (3, 4) |a| = √(3² + 4²) = √9 + 16 = √25 = 5`

## Real-World Applications of Vectors
### **Physics & Engineering**
- **Motion calculations** (speed, direction, acceleration).
- **Ricocheting bullets in games**.
- **Object movement in simulations**.
- **Design of vehicle braking & suspension systems**.

### **Computer Graphics & Gaming**
- **3D rendering** (lighting, shading, object positioning).
- **Projectile motion** (Angry Birds, racing games, flight simulators).

### **Machine Learning & AI**
- **Feature representation** in models.
- **Classification problems** use vector spaces for pattern recognition.

### **Navigation**
- **Airplane landing adjustments** based on wind direction.
- **GPS calculations** to determine routes.

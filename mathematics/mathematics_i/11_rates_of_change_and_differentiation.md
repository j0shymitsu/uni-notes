## Introduction
- **Rates of change** show how fast something is increasing or decreasing.
- Critical in fields like **epidemiology, chemistry, computing, and physics**.
- Calculus allows us to model and calculate these rates.

## Why Rates of Change Matter
### **In Epidemics**
- The rate at which infection spreads determines **how healthcare resources will cope**.
- “Flattening the curve” is about reducing the **rate of change** of infections.

### **In Chemical Reactions**
- Faster reaction rates mean **higher efficiency**.
- Requires more energy (heat) without catalysts, which **increases costs and time**.

### **In Algorithms**
- Different algorithms have different time complexities.
- Faster algorithms handle more data efficiently and save **energy and cost**.
- Especially relevant in **big data, AI, and gaming**.

### **In Motion**
- Acceleration and deceleration are rates of change in speed.
- Safe braking is as important as acceleration.

## Understanding Slopes on Graphs
- Real-world data often forms curves.
- **The slope (gradient)** of a curve shows **rate of change**.
- Example: Acceleration graph of a bike:
  - Steep slope in first gear → rapid speed increase.
  - Flattening in higher gears due to air resistance.
- Compare slopes to assess rate of acceleration.

## Differentiation
### **Key Definitions**
- `dy` means a **tiny change in y**.
- `dx` means a **tiny change in x**.
- The ratio `dy/dx` represents the **instantaneous rate of change** (gradient).

### **Newton and the Origins of Calculus**
- Invented **differential calculus** to understand changing motion.
- Foundations for physics, engineering, and modern computing.

### **Rules of Differentiation**
- Derivative of a **constant** is **zero** (flat line).
- General rule for polynomials:
  ```
  d/dx (ax^n) = nax^(n-1)
  ```

### **Linear Equations**
- Based on `y = mx + c`.
- Differentiating gives the slope `m`.
- Useful for understanding **rates in straight-line graphs**.

### **Quadratic Equations**
- For a parabola (e.g. `y = ax^2`):
  - Gradient is **negative** when `x < 0`
  - Gradient is **zero** at the turning point `x = 0`
  - Gradient is **positive** when `x > 0`
- Differentiation gives the slope at each point.

### **Maxima and Minima**
- Occur when the gradient is zero (`dy/dx = 0`).
- Can find the `x` value for **minimum or maximum**.

### **Further Rules**
- Product Rule, Quotient Rule, Chain Rule (covered briefly).
- More detailed explanations available via:
  - Bird’s Engineering Mathematics, Chapter 36
  - Online sources: BetterExplained, MathIsFun, Khan Academy

## Integration
- **Reverse of differentiation**.
- Calculates the **area under a curve**.
- Important in **modelling total outcomes**:
  - E.g., total hospitalisations during a pandemic.
- Used in **epidemiology, physics, and engineering**.
- You won’t need to do integration in the exam, but understand what it means.

---

## Exam Preparation
- Review slides and external references.
- Study the **‘Differentiation – Notes’** sheet on Moodle.
- Work through quizzes on Teams.
- Use Bird’s Engineering Mathematics (Ch. 36).
- Attend revision sessions from Academic Skills (ASk).
- Final revision and exam guidance will be given in the last session.

## Conclusion
- Rates of change are critical in science, computing, and real-world problem solving.
- **Differentiation** helps us understand these changes at specific points.
- **Integration** helps calculate cumulative effects.
- Mastering these concepts provides a solid foundation in applied mathematics.

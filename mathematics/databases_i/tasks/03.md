1. A college wishes to computerise its student records. They want to include these fields:-
EnrolNo, Surname, Forenames, Gender, DateOfBirth, PersonalTutorID, PersonalTutorName, ModuleNo, ModuleTitle, Mark, Result

Assume that each student studies several modules and that there is a mark and result for each.

```SQL
    -- 1NF
    Student_Module(EnrolNo, Surname, Forenames, Gender, DateOfBirth, PersonalTutorID, PersonalTutorName, ModuleNo, ModuleTitle, Mark, Result)

    -- 2NF
    Student(EnrolNo, Surname, Forenames, Gender, DateOfBirth)
    Module(ModuleNo, ModuleTitle)
    StudentModule(EnrolNo, ModuleNo, Mark, Result)
    Tutor(PersonalTutorID, PersonalTutorName)

2. A university department wants a database to store data about its computing books. The books are bought via a series of salesmen who each sell books from several publishers. The books are then lent out to students.
The BookNo identifies each book uniquely and the ISBN identifies each different title. There may be several copies of the same book. The fields which need to be stored are as follows:
BookNo, ISBN, Title, Author, Publisher, SalesmanID, SalesmanName, SalesmanPhone, StudentNo, StudentName, StudentPhone, ReturnDate, DepositPaid, DepositReturned

Normalise the data to third normal form showing each stage in your working.

```SQL
    -- 1NF
    Computing_Books(BookNo, ISBN, Title, Author, Publisher, SalesmanID, SalesmanName, SalesmanPhone, StudentNo, StudentName, StudentPhone, ReturnDate, DepositPaid, DepositReturned)

    -- 2NF
    Books(BookNo, ISBN, Title, Author, Publisher)
    Seller(SalesmanID, SalesmanName, SalesmanPhone)
    Students(StudentNo, StudentName, StudentPhone)
    Loans(ReturnDate, DepositPaid, DepositReturned)

3. An agency letting country cottages wishes to computerise its records. It has a number of properties, which it lets by the week on behalf of the owners. Each property is identified by its brochure number and has a different basic rental, which is then multiplied by a tariff, which varies according to the time of year. An initial analysis of the companyâ€™s needs has indicated the data items that it wishes to record which are listed below.
BrochureNo, PropertyAddress, PropertyTown, Bedrooms, WeekNo, Tariff, ClientName, ClientAddress, ClientPhone, SizeofParty, OwnersName, OwnersAddress, OwnersPhone

```SQL
    -- 1NF
    Country_Cottages(BrochureNo, PropertyAddress, PropertyTown, Bedrooms, WeekNo, Tariff, ClientName, ClientAddress, ClientPhone, SizeofParty, OwnersName, OwnersAddress, OwnersPhone)

    -- 2NF
    Properties(BrochureNo, PropertyAddress, PropertyTown, Bedrooms, OwnersName)
    Rentals(BrochureNo, WeekNo)
    Owners(OwnersName, OwnersAddress, OwnersPhone)

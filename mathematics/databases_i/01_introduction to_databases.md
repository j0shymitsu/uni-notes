## KEY POINTS
### Definition
- A database is an **organised collection of data** that is structure in such a way as to facilitate the efficiency of the:
  - storage
  - retrieval
  - modification, and
  - management
of information.

### Normalisation
- When it's structure is written out formally, this is called **normalistaion**. [2]

### Tables
- Tables are entities which we want to store data **about**. For example: staff, students, patients.
- The table is essentially the "drawer of the filing cabinet".

### Data Types
- Fields can be of different types:
  - int; smallint - numbers typically used for fields such as age. (Exact numerics)
  - float; real - numbers with a decimal, such as temperature. (Approximate numerics)
  - char - used for words or text (fixed length).
  - varchar - same as char, but *not* fixed length.
  - data; time - for example DOB.
  - bit - boolean (T or F).

### DBMS
- A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is used to access data stored in many linked tables.
- In the SQL Server Database Engine, each column, local variable, expression and parameter has a related data type. You can also define **your own** data types in **Transact-SQL** or the **Microsoft.NET Framework.**

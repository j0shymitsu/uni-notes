## Introduction
- **Accessibility** ensures that digital services can be used by people with a wide range of abilities.
- It addresses ethical, legal, and usability concerns.
- Compliance with standards like **WCAG** is essential for websites and applications.

---

## Importance of Accessibility
- **Ethical and Moral Considerations:**
  - Inclusive access for all users.
- **Legal Implications:**
  - Failing to make reasonable adjustments can lead to lawsuits.
  - Case examples:
    - PMI v Latif (2007) – £3,000 settlement.
    - RNIB v BMIBaby (2012).
    - Weston Health Trust (2023) – £3,000 settlement.
    - Student Loans Company (2021) – £5,000 settlement.

---

## Legal Requirements
- Under the **Equality Act 2010**, services must make "reasonable adjustments".
- Public sector bodies must ensure websites and apps are:
  - **Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust**
- Governed by the **Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018**.

---

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
- **Developed by W3C**.
- Current version: **WCAG 2.2** (published 2023).
- UK organizations have obligations to conform to these guidelines.
- Key document: [WCAG 2.2 Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/REC-WCAG22-20231005/)

## 4 Principles of WCAG

### **Perceivable**
- Information must be **presentable to users' senses**.
- **4 guidelines:**
  1. **Text Alternatives:** Provide alt text for images, captions for media.
  2. **Time-Based Media:** Alternatives for video/audio content.
  3. **Adaptable:** Content should work in different formats.
  4. **Distinguishable:** Sufficient contrast, clear audio separation.

### **Operable**
- Users must be able to **navigate and interact** with the UI.
- **5 guidelines:**
  1. **Keyboard Accessible:** No mouse required.
  2. **Enough Time:** Allow user control over time-based content.
  3. **Seizures and Physical Reactions:** Avoid content that could cause seizures.
  4. **Navigable:** Clear navigation, skip links, headings.
  5. **Input Modalities:** Support different input methods (touch, keyboard).

### **Understandable**
- Information and operation must be **clear and predictable**.
- **3 guidelines:**
  1. **Readable:** Use clear language, define unusual terms.
  2. **Predictable:** Consistent behavior, prevent surprise actions.
  3. **Input Assistance:** Help users avoid/correct input errors.

### **Robust**
- Content must be **compatible with current and future technologies**.
- **1 guideline:**
  - **Compatible:** Elements must expose name, role, and value (ARIA attributes).
  - Example: `<button aria-label="Close">X</button>`.

## WCAG Compliance Levels
- Techniques are categorized into levels:
  - **A:** Basic accessibility.
  - **AA:** Addresses biggest barriers for users.
  - **AAA:** Highest level of accessibility.
- Example for time-based media:
  - A: Captions for prerecorded audio.
  - AA: Audio description for videos.
  - AAA: Sign language interpretation.

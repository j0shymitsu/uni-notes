## Introduction
- Focus on **User Interface (UI)** design principles.
- Investigate the **User Interface design process**.
- Examine aspects such as:
  - **Navigation design**
  - **Input design**
  - **Output design**

---

## System Interfaces
- Defines how the system interacts with **external entities** (e.g., customers, suppliers, other systems).
- **System interfaces** exchange data with external systems (e.g., ordering system).
- Designed during **system integration stage**.
- User interface design defines **user interaction** with the system.

---

## User Interface
- Aims to balance features for effective system use, including:
  - **Simplicity**
  - **Appearance**
  - **Effectiveness**
- A **usable system** is easy to learn and increases speed and accuracy.

---

## Usability
- Key interface design principles:
  - **Layout**
  - **Content awareness**
  - **Aesthetics**
  - **User experience**
  - **Consistency**
  - **Minimal user effort**

---

## User Interface Design Principles
### Layout
- Organises screens, forms, or reports.
- Standard approach divides screens into three areas:
  - **Top**: Navigation.
  - **Middle**: Userâ€™s workspace.
  - **Bottom**: Status information.
- Components should be structured **consistently**.
- Consider touchscreens (e.g., place content above navigation buttons).

### Content Awareness
- UI should require minimal user effort to understand its contents.
- Should include:
  - **Titles** on screen frames.
  - **Menus** showing current location (e.g., breadcrumb trail).
  - **Forms and reports** with clear field names and appropriate headings.

### Aesthetics
- **Balance space and information**:
  - Experienced users prefer dense information.
  - Too little white space deters usability.
- **Font style and size** impact readability.
- **Colour** can:
  - Separate and categorise items.
  - Highlight important information.

### User Experience
- Consider user experience levels:
  - **Novice users**: Prioritise ease of learning.
  - **Experienced users**: Prioritise task efficiency.

### Consistency
- Enhances **predictability** and usability.
- Operates at multiple levels:
  - **Navigation**
  - **Terminology** (e.g., same word for elements across forms)
  - **Form design**
- Users can transfer existing knowledge across systems.

### Minimal User Effort
- Design should **minimise user actions**:
  - Fewer mouse clicks/keystrokes.
  - **3-click rule**: Users should reach information within 3 clicks.
- **Touchscreens** are inefficient for data entry.
  - Use **selection-based** input (e.g., dropdowns) over typing.

---

## User Interface Design Process
An **iterative process** with five main steps:
1. **Understand the users**.
2. **Organise the interface**.
3. **Define standards** (or use predefined ones).
4. **Develop prototypes**.
5. **Evaluate** (repeat steps as needed).

---

## Define Interface Standards
- Maintain design consistency across screens, forms, and reports.
- **Interface metaphors**:
  - Examples: Recycle Bin (delete), Shopping Cart (purchase), Calendar.
- **Interface templates**:
  - Define layout, colour scheme, menu configuration, fonts.
- **Interface icons**:
  - Use labels with hover text for clarity.

---

## Navigation Design
- Aim for **broad and shallow** menu structures:
  - Fewer layers, more accessible functions.
  - Cluster related functions together.
- Menus are less useful for **touchscreen** apps.
- **Error messages** should be:
  - **Concise and unambiguous**.
  - Provide clear guidance on corrections.

---

## Input Design
- Goal: **Capture accurate information efficiently**.
- Screen design should accommodate input types (e.g., date pickers for dates).
- **Source Data Automation** reduces user input errors:
  - Examples: Barcode scanners, NFC (e.g., contactless payments).
  - Use **dropdowns, checkboxes** to minimise keystrokes.
- Perform automatic calculations where possible.

---

## Input Validation
Six types of validation:
1. **Completeness Check**: Ensures all fields are filled.
2. **Format Check**: Ensures correct data format (e.g., numeric, date).
3. **Range Check**: Ensures values fall within acceptable limits.
4. **Check Digit**: Verifies numeric codes (e.g., credit card numbers).
5. **Consistency Check**: Ensures logical consistency across data (e.g., birthdate before school start date).
6. **Database Check**: Compares entered data against existing records.

---

## Output Design
- **System reports** manage information load.
- Reports should:
  - Present ordered, structured data.
  - Allow users to **identify relevant information easily**.
- **Graphical displays** should:
  - Use appropriate scales.
  - Avoid misleading visual representations.

---

## Conclusion
- Introduced key **User Interface (UI) Design** principles.
- Investigated the **User Interface design process**.
- Examined specific aspects including:
  - **Navigation design**
  - **Input design**
  - **Output design**
- Emphasised the importance of designing UI components based on **user needs**.

## Introduction
- **Version control** helps track and manage changes in software projects.
- **Software testing** ensures that applications function as expected and meet quality standards.
- Both practices are fundamental in **software development and DevOps**.

---

## What is Version Control?
- Also known as **source control**, version control is a **system that tracks code changes**.
- It allows multiple developers to collaborate efficiently and manage different versions of software.

### **Why Use Version Control?**
- Enables **collaboration** among team members.
- Provides **history tracking** for changes.
- Helps in **rollback and recovery** in case of errors.
- Essential for **continuous integration and DevOps**.

### **Common Version Control Systems**
- **Git (with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)** – Most widely used.
- **Subversion (SVN)** – Centralized version control.
- **Mercurial** – Similar to Git but less commonly used.

Example of basic Git usage:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

## What is Software Testing?
- **Software testing** verifies that a system **meets requirements and functions correctly**.
- Testing helps prevent **bugs**, improves **performance**, and reduces **development costs**.

### **Importance of Testing**
- Ensures **software reliability**.
- Identifies and fixes **bugs early**.
- Improves **security, usability, and scalability**.

### **Testing Roles and Standards**
- **Software Testers (QA Engineers)**:
  - May hold certifications like **ISTQB Certified Tester**.
  - Ensure software meets **industry standards**.
- **Software Developers & Security Experts**:
  - Often write and automate tests.
  - Perform security testing.

---

## Types of Software Testing
### **Unit Testing**
- Tests **individual functions or classes**.
- Often automated with tools like **JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), or Jest (JavaScript)**.
- Example:
  ```java
  @Test
  public void testAddition() {
      assertEquals(5, Calculator.add(2, 3));
  }
  ```

### **Integration Testing**
- Ensures that **modules work together correctly**.
- Conducted **after unit testing but before system testing**.

### **System Testing**
- Evaluates the **entire system** to ensure all components work together.
- Verifies that **business requirements** are met.

### **Acceptance Testing**
- Confirms if software meets **user requirements** before deployment.
- **Types of Acceptance Testing:**
  - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** – Performed by actual users.
  - **Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT)** – Ensures stability before release.
  - **Alpha/Beta Testing** – Conducted before public release.

### **Security Testing**
- Evaluates how well a system is protected against **unauthorized access**.
- Ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**.
- Often performed using **penetration testing tools**.

---

## Writing a Test Plan
1. **Analyze Requirements**
   - Define what the software should do.
   - Identify **user expectations**.
2. **Develop Test Strategy**
   - Define the **testing scope, type, and objectives**.
   - Estimate **effort and costs**.
3. **Identify Testing Types**
   - Choose between **manual or automated testing**.
   - Use frameworks like **Selenium, JUnit, or Postman for API testing**.
4. **Execute Tests and Analyze Results**
   - Run tests and compare results against **expected outcomes**.

---

## Conclusion
- **Version control** enables efficient team collaboration and history tracking.
- **Software testing** ensures that applications work as intended.
- Different **testing types** address various aspects of software quality.
- Understanding and applying best practices in both areas improves **software reliability and maintainability**.

## Stakeholders
- **Definition**:
  - Individuals or organisations actively involved in the project or impacted by its outcome (positively or negatively).
  - Examples:
    - Clients, users, employees, and even competitors.
  - **Project Management Institute Definition**:

## Stakeholder Management
- **Purpose**:
  - Organise, monitor, and improve relationships with stakeholders.
- **Modern Context**:
  - Unlike traditional IT projects with clear start and end points, the cloud era requires continuous cycles of change and improvement.

### Tips for Managing Stakeholders
1. Identify stakeholders at the project’s start.
2. Ensure all stakeholders agree on deliverables and roles.
3. Gain consensus on handling project changes.
4. Communicate effectively.
5. Keep the project vision visible.
6. Engage stakeholders throughout the process.
7. Define what “done” means.
8. Empathise with other stakeholders.

## Mendelow’s Matrix
- **Definition**:
  - A tool for categorising stakeholders based on their **Power** (influence on the project) and **Interest** (level of interest in the project’s success).

## Requirements Documentation
1. **User Requirements**:
   - Focus on how users interact with the system and their expectations.
   - Written in plain English, avoiding technical jargon.
   - Leads to modelling techniques such as UML.

2. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Define what the system must do to serve the user.
   - Example: A doctor’s surgery website allowing patients to book appointments.

3. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - Focus on system characteristics unrelated to direct user interaction:
     - Security, reliability, response time, ethical considerations, and data storage.

4. **System Requirements**:
   - Technical specifications including architecture, hardware, software, and peripherals.

## Project Lifecycle
- Typically an **iterative process**, where development occurs incrementally.

---

## Change Management
- **Definition**:
  - Transitioning a software product from its current state to an improved one.
  - Manages changes to:
    - Code.
    - Processes.
    - Documentation.

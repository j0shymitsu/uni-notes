## What is Risk Management?
- **Definition**:
  - The process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks that could impact a software project.
- **Purpose**:
  - Anticipate risks and understand their impact on the **project**, **product**, and **business**.
  - Take proactive steps to **minimize or avoid risks**.

---

## Risk Classification
- Risks are categorized based on **type** and **impact**:
  1. **Project Risks**:
     - Affect schedules, costs, and resources.
  2. **Product Risks**:
     - Affect software quality, performance, and usability.
  3. **Business Risks**:
     - Affect the organization developing or procuring the software.

## Risk Identification
- **Key Risk Areas**:
  - **Technology Risks**: Issues with tools, frameworks, or dependencies.
  - **Organizational Risks**: Restructuring, policy changes, or financial constraints.
  - **People Risks**: Employee turnover, lack of expertise.
  - **Requirements Risks**: Changes in scope, incomplete specifications.
  - **Estimation Risks**: Miscalculations in time, cost, or resource allocation.

## Risk Management Process
1. **Risk Identification**:
   - Recognize potential risks using checklists, expert opinions, and historical data.
2. **Risk Analysis**:
   - Assess probability (low, moderate, high) and impact (insignificant to catastrophic).
3. **Risk Planning**:
   - Develop strategies to handle risks:
     - **Avoidance**: Reduce the probability of risk occurrence.
     - **Minimization**: Reduce the impact if the risk occurs.
     - **Contingency Plans**: Prepare responses for when a risk materializes.
4. **Risk Monitoring**:
   - Regularly review and update risks throughout the project lifecycle.
   - Discuss key risks in management progress meetings.

## Risk Assessment Techniques
### **PESTLE Analysis**
- **Definition**: A structured method for risk identification based on external factors.
- **Components**:
  - **Political**: Trade tariffs, taxation, government policies.
  - **Economic**: Inflation, interest rates, market stability.
  - **Social**: Demographic shifts, consumer behavior, workplace trends.
  - **Technological**: Emerging technologies, innovation risks.
  - **Legal**: Regulatory compliance, intellectual property laws.
  - **Environmental**: Climate, sustainability, location-based risks.

### **SWOT Analysis**
- **Definition**: A framework for evaluating internal and external factors.
- **Categories**:
  - **Strengths**: Internal advantages and capabilities.
  - **Weaknesses**: Internal limitations and constraints.
  - **Opportunities**: External factors that could be leveraged.
  - **Threats**: External risks that could impact success.

## Example "What If?" Scenarios
- What if **several engineers** fall ill at the same time?
- What if **budget cuts** reduce project funding by 20%?
- What if **critical software dependencies** are no longer maintained?
- What if **customer requirements change** unexpectedly?

---

## Risk Monitoring & Indicators
- Regularly assess risk probabilities and their effects.
- Use **key risk indicators** to track trends and detect increasing threats.
- Maintain **ongoing communication** in management meetings.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Risk management** is essential for anticipating and mitigating software project uncertainties.
2. **Risk classification** (Project, Product, Business) helps prioritize response strategies.
3. **PESTLE and SWOT** provide structured approaches for assessing risks.
4. **Regular monitoring and planning** ensure risks are managed proactively.

## What is Software Engineering?
- Defined by Sommerville (2016):
  > "An engineering discipline concerned with all aspects of software production, from initial conception to operation and maintenance."
- **Comparison with Computer Science**:
  - Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals.
  - Software engineering emphasizes practicalities of developing and delivering software.

---

## Importance of Software Engineering
- Software is pervasive:
  - Home electronics, mobile phones, cars, aircraft, networking, and the web.
- Creates reliable, secure, and maintainable solutions.
- Supports existing software.
- Streamlines business processes and improves decision-making.

---

## Types of Software
1. **Generic**: 
   - Standalone systems for a wide audience (e.g., graphics editors, project management tools).
2. **Bespoke**:
   - Customized software for specific needs (e.g., embedded control systems, air traffic control).

---

## Characteristics of Good Software
1. **Acceptability**:
   - Must be understandable, usable, and compatible with other systems.
2. **Dependability and Security**:
   - Reliable and safe, protecting against malicious users.
3. **Efficiency**:
   - Optimal use of system resources (e.g., memory, processor).
4. **Maintainability**:
   - Easy to evolve with changing customer needs.

---

## Software Costs
- Software is often the most expensive system component.
- Maintenance typically exceeds initial development costs.
- Long life expectancies increase total costs significantly.

---

## Professionalism and Ethics
### Key Principles:
1. **Confidentiality**:
   - Respect employer/client confidentiality, formal agreements are common.
2. **Competence**:
   - Do not misrepresent skills or accept tasks outside your expertise.
3. **Intellectual Property**:
   - Adhere to laws on patents and copyrights.
4. **Computer Misuse**:
   - Avoid using skills for unethical purposes (e.g., spreading malware).

### Additional Guidance:
- Follow codes of conduct, e.g., BCS (British Computer Society) Code of Conduct:

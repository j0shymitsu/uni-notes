## What is Project Management?
- **Definition**:
  - The process of planning and controlling system development within a **specified timeframe**, **minimum cost**, and with the **correct functionality**.
- **Project Manager (PM)**:
  - Responsible for overall coordination.
  - Balances **time**, **cost**, and **system size**.

## Key Processes in Project Management
### Scheduling:
1. **Steps**:
   - Assess the problem.
   - Assess the solution:
     - Deliverables.
     - Activities.
   - Calculate the time needed to complete the project.
2. **Deliverables**:
   - Documents: Specification, design, program code.
   - Technical and user guides.
   - Demonstrations: Functionality, reliability, security, speed, etc.
3. **Activities and Milestones**:
   - **Milestone**: Completion of an activity.
   - Projects are broken into **structured phases** with multiple activities per phase.

### Costing:
1. **Factors**:
   - Facilities: Development hardware, software, accommodation, overheads.
   - People: Salaries, estimated hours (Cost = Hours Ã— Hourly Pay).
   - Methods & Tools:
     - Training requirements.
     - Time for meetings and documentation.
2. **Challenges**:
   - Complexity of projects.
   - Difficulty estimating costs due to the unique nature of software engineering.

## Scheduling: Methods and Tools
- **Activity Graphs**:
  - **Critical Path Method (CPM)**:
    - Identifies the **longest path** from project start to completion.
    - Delays in critical tasks will delay the project.
  - **PERT (Programme Evaluation and Review Technique)**:
    - Developed by NASA with strictly defined procedures.
- **Gantt Charts**:
  - Visual representation of:
    - Activities, durations, dependencies.
    - Milestones and temporal relationships.
  - Resource smoothing to improve efficiency.

### Rough Guide to Scheduling:
- **Requirements Analysis & Design**:
  - Requires twice as long as coding.
- **Validation**:
  - Takes as long as analysis and design.
- Add contingencies for anticipated and unanticipated problems.

## Risk Management
- **Causes of Risk**:
  - Personnel problems.
  - Scope creep.
  - Poor design.
  - Inaccurate estimates.
- **Risk Assessment Document**:
  - Tracks risks, their likelihood, and potential impact.
  - Identifies strategies:
    - **Avoidance**: Prevent the issue.
    - **Transfer**: Share responsibility (e.g., insurance or external team).
    - **Reduction**: Minimise likelihood.
    - **Retention**: Accept and plan for the issue.

## Standards and Documentation
- **Importance**:
  - Ensures team members follow the same procedures and regulations.
  - Simplifies coordination.
- **Examples**:
  - File naming rules.
  - Programming guidelines.
  - Task completion forms.
- **Documentation**:
  - Maintain system history to avoid losing details.
  - Ensure effective code documentation for future reference.

## Summary
- **Topics Covered**:
  1. Tasks involved in project management.
  2. Methods for estimating costs and time.
  3. Creating and refining workplans.
  4. Importance of standards and documentation.
  5. Risk management strategies.

## Tools for Project Management
1. **CPM and PERT** for scheduling.
2. **Gantt Charts** for tracking progress and dependencies.
3. Use estimation rules and refine them as the project progresses.

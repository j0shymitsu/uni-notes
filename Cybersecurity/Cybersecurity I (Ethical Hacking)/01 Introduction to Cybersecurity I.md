## Evolution of Information Technology
- **1970s**:
  - Mainframes, dumb terminals.
- **1980s**:
  - Personal computers.
- **2000s**:
  - Laptops, desktops, mobile phones, pagers, PDAs.
- **2010s-Present Day**:
  - Tablets, smartphones, smart watches, smart home devices, AR/VR devices, AI advancements.
- **Key Point**:
  - As technology evolves, so do associated security challenges.

## Cybersecurity
- **Definitions**:
  1. **Information Assurance** (Cooper, 2010):
     - Ensures confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity of information systems.
  2. **Cybersecurity** (Kissel, 2011):
     - Protects cyberspace from cyberattacks.
  3. **Computer Security** (Kissel, 2011):
     - Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information system assets.
- **The CIA Triad**:
  - **Confidentiality**: Ensures data is not disclosed to unauthorized entities.
  - **Integrity**: Ensures data accuracy and trustworthiness.
  - **Availability**: Ensures data and systems are accessible when needed.

## Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Attacks
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Vulnerability**:
    - A weakness that exposes a system to potential threats.
  - **Zero-Day Vulnerability**:
    - Unknown or unaddressed vulnerabilities exploited by attackers until patched.
  - **Exploit**:
    - Code designed to take advantage of vulnerabilities.
- **Types of Attacks**:
  - May target the Internet Protocol stack or specific vulnerabilities.

---

## Social Engineering
- **Definition**:
  - Manipulating individuals to divulge confidential information.
- **Techniques**:
  - Emails, phone calls, voicemails, or text messages to gain sensitive information (e.g., passwords, bank details).

---

## Malware
- **Definition**:
  - Malicious code that exploits system vulnerabilities.
- **Types**:
  - Trojan horses, rootkits, viruses, worms, and backdoors.
- **Behavior**:
  - Some malware requires a host program, while others propagate independently.

---

## Buffer Overflow
- **Definition**:
  - Occurs when more data is written than allocated for a variable.
- **Consequences**:
  - Can lead to crashes, variable manipulation, or control over processes.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Overflows memory allocated for one variable into adjacent memory spaces.

---

## Security Measures and Controls
1. **Access Control**:
   - Principle of least privilege, user and group management.
2. **Firewalls and IDS**:
   - Firewalls: Use policies to control traffic.
   - IDS: Monitor and report policy violations.
3. **IT Governance**:
   - Risk management and compliance (e.g., ISO27001).
4. **Secure Programming**:
   - Defensive coding to prevent injection attacks and minimize bugs.
5. **Cryptography**:
   - Encryption to ensure confidentiality (e.g., ROT13 substitution cipher).

---

## Activities
1. **Discussion Task**:
   - Explore the CIA triad, attackers, methods, and controls.
2. **Formative Homework**:
   - Research recent exploits and discuss in the next class.

## Key Takeaways
1. Cybersecurity involves protecting cyberspace through confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
2. Threats exploit vulnerabilities, often using techniques like social engineering, malware, or buffer overflows.
3. Security measures like access control, cryptography, and defensive programming help mitigate risks.
